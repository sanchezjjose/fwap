What's Good
===========

This is a single page web application, with the simple goal of showing
places are trending near you.

My inspiration for this came from times I wanted to go somewhere, but
did not know where or what to do.

It uses your Geolocation and currently the Foursquare API to see where
the top checkins are near you. Eventually, this will include other API's,
such as Twitter, to possibly use hashtags as well.

Also, an iOS version of this web application, consuming it's JSON endpoints will
eventually be released.

Stay tuned!
